        This API finds any NBA's player bio using an ID number that is based 
        on an array of players that are arranged in alphabetical order of the 
        player's last name. The website I found this on is 
        https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction The option I used for this API 
        request was the ID number for Jaylen Brown which is based on his last 
        name. This was how I was able to access his information. This API would 
        be helpful to find the height, weight, or position of a NBA player.
        The ony downside to this API is that the ID numbers to find a specific
        player aren't made clear so I plugged in random IDs to get 
        closer and closer until I found Jaylen Brown.
